Coding style guide
==================

Python code
-----------
We have followed the `PEP 08 -- Style Guide for Python Code
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.

Docstrings
----------
We have followed the `PEP 257 -- Docstring Conventions
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ and the recommendations of the
*Google Python Style Guide* for docstrings in functions (point `3.8.1
<http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#383-functions-and-methods>`_).

According to the GNU General Public License, a copyright notice is included in
every module.

Documentation
-------------
Some help documents have been written using markdown (README.md,
package_description.md).

The user manual has been generated using ``sphinx`` from files using
`reStructuredText
<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`_
markup language. The documentation translated into French has been created
using ``sphinx-intl``.
